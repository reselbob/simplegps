## Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to demonstate how to capture events generated by a GPS device connected to a Raspberry Pi and then publish the events into a message broker such as Redis or Kafaka.

This project is intended to run on a Linux system. The project requires that the [GPSD](https://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2018/210/Tutorial-gpsd) daemon is installed and running on the host machine.
